# ChatHub

A chat room app. Used this project for experience with Bootstrap modals, promise callbacks, and working with the Firebase API.

## Trying it out

Presumably anyone who would have reason to be exploring my project already has NodeJS and NPM installed, in which case once you pull down this project you can run it with the basic `npm start` command and explore it. If you need to see this project and that doesn't work for you, let me know and I can make a Heroku version perhaps.

It will require you to set a username when you begin, but security and authorizations weren't a focus of this project so no other password or steps are required to begin testing it out.
