# ChatHub

A chat room app. Used this project for experience with Bootstrap modals, promise callbacks, and working with the Firebase API.

## Trying it out

Assuming you already have NodeJS and NPM installed, once you pull down this project and install dependencies you can run it with the basic `npm start` command and explore it.

It will require you to set a username when you begin, but security and authorizations weren't a focus of this project so no other password or steps are required to begin testing it out.
